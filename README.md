# Contributions to Open Research in code
 - Notebooks 
 - Apps
 - APIs _a single end-point API for a task that is powered behind the scenes by the current SOTA solution for that task - coming soon... ðŸš€_
    - When APIs are eventually exposed for models with permissive licenses, [contact me](mailto:twc@taskswithcode.com) if you need a privately hosted API end-point that is of use to your business. When that happens, any profit will be shared equally with the researcher whose model was used in the API.
